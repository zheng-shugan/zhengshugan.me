New blog is fork on [renovamen.github.io](https://github.com/Renovamen/renovamen.github.io).

The most important thing is I can read this project code and understand how it works, so I forked it and changed some information to make it my own blog.

And this time the project is hosted on Vercel, last year the website deployed on Vercel can still be accessed through the mainland network by custom domain name, but this year it seems to be completely dead, my .me domain name cannot be filed in China, so it cannot be migrated to domestic cloud service providers. Although GitHub Pages is slow, it can still be accessed, and I may redeploy the website to GitHub Pages later.
